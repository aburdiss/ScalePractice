<i>Scale Practice</i> helps musicians practice their scales, by randomizing the order of scales and providing resources to learn about new scales. It contains three different functions:

1. Random scale chosen from a list of scale types
2. Random scale chosen from a list of user inputted scales
3. Scale resources, including images of each scale and descriptions

<b>Features:</b>

* Diverse Scale Selection (Major, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Major Modes, Melodic Minor Modes, Blues Scale, Pentatonic Scales, Octatonic Scales, Whole Tone Scales)
* Arpeggio Practic
* Resources to help you learn new scales
* Random selection from user selected scales

This app does not listen to you practice, or provide you feedback in any way. It is only designed to give you a new order to practice your scales in.
